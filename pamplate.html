        <h3>The festival observes the victory of good over evil and dharma over adharma.The Rama Navami festival celebration starts with jalam (water) offering in the early morning to Surya (the sun god) to propitiate him.
             This is due to the belief that the descendants of Surya were the ancestors of Rama.</h3>
